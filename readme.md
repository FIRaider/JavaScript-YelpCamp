This is my first full-stack I have built in an attempt to improve my JavaScript knowledge programming skillset.
It incorporates dynamic HTML (EJS), nodeJS back-end with MongoDB, and uses express on the front end.
By building this project, I have learned more of the nuances on how to compartmentalize problems and build more robust systems.
